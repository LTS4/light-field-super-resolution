If you use or adapt this code in your work (either as a stand-alone tool or as a component of any algorithm), you need to cite the appropriate articles [1],[2].  
This code is for academic purpose only: not for commercial or industrial activities.

# How to run the code

1.The Heidelberg and Stanford light field dataset that are mentioned in our articles [1][2] are provided (by their respective creators) with different file formats and reference systems. Download the two light field dataset and then run the script importdata.m to convert all the light fields to the same format and reference system. Please note that the two dataset have to be downloaded from their respective websites (references to the two datasets are provided in [1][2]).
